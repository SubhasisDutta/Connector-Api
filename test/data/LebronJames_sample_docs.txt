You think lebron couldn't handle that? LOL...  How about this... Lebron had to play with absolute scrubs from his rook year up to his 4th year and then had to play with what are now backups from his? 4th to his 7th year. Kobe had to do that for 3 years and what did he do? demand a trade and throw everyone under the bus. 3 years!  Playing w/ prime shaq is a privilege.

Or the fact that you believe LeBron got to the finals on his own. If he never joined D. Wade he'd still be ringless. But that's neither here nor there. He's not getting another ring this year. The Heat's roster is not strong enough for another title. The way the East is getting stronger? there's no way. But you Heat fans continue to believe what you want. I could give 2 shits.

Hell Bill doesn't even have a finals mvp because it was made like in 1970 or sometime around then because Wilt has one in 1972. Also it was like 10-12 teams then I'm not sure about playoffs but i know they played the full 82 game season. Point is I can't say they are the best partly due to the time period and competition. Thats why i basically started post merger.

724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DUR-OV_QfnOP-Iatr0YlampqkmK3LqLWuw	The best players has? to be great at both defense and offense. My top 3 is 1# Jordan (of course) 2# Bird 3#Olajuwon. I basically started at the Aba/Nba Merger 1976. That would at least make 20+ teams. Jordan and Dream were both DPOY(Dream 2) and Bird was known as a great defender who can guard many positions. All was multi time MVPs and Finals MVPs. Magic although great offensively defense was suspect at times. Kareem pre merger was better than post when he got most awards. cont

You try overcoming the best and most dominant player ever. Kobe did overcome him I don't think Lebron would have. Thats why he didn't get his first ring against Dallas and it was just wade. So I think its not fair to talk about Kobe and Shaq when the pressure was all on Kobe to start? his legacy. No one had Prime shaq to over come. Closes thing was Penny but he couldn't also thats why they lost.

It was irrelevant. 2011 was his first year with all new teammates, new coach, and new system. He actually went to Miami with the idea that he wouldn't have to carry the scoring load. Pat Riley sold him the? idea that he would be like Magic Johnson, Wade would be Kobe, and Bosh would be Kevin Garnett. But apparently they still need Lebron to lead the team in scoring, assists, and rebounds to win so thats what he did the last 2 years."

They then conveniently forget all the things they were saying before and the? lack of well defined leadership and roles which existed, just like you are now."

Maybe he should have took over in the 4th quarters, but in 2011 it wasn't clear who the leader was so I don't see why you assume that was established. I remember the majority of people in 2011 were saying it was still Wade's team. People saying Wade was the? closer, and was Batman while Lebron was Robin. Throughout the season and playoffs you saw some games Lebron took more shots, while other games Wade did."

Chito Salud re Marc Pingris, Kelly Nabong, Joe Devance, Marvin Hayes and the San Mig Coffee-GlobalPort incident:  Upon review of the incident in the San Mig Coffee - GlobalPort game of September 4, 2013 and after meeting with the players involved, the Office of the Commissioner is meting out the following sanctions: 1. Marvin Hayes is fined P20,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct, equivalent to a flagrant foul penalty 2,for elbowing and kneeing import Marqus Blakely on the floor after a foul had already been called. 2. Kelly Nabong is suspended for 2 games and fined P 60,000 for attacking import Marqus Blakely and exchanging blows with Marc Pingris. 3. Marc Pingris is suspended for 2 games and fined P60,000 for fighting and engaging Kelly Nabong in an exchange of blows. 4. Joe Devance is suspended for 1 game and fined P30,000 for triggering the commotion that led to the fight between Kelly Nabong and Marc Pingris. Fighting will not be condoned by the league. There is absolutely no justification for our players to get involved in fistfights. Strong emphasis is being placed on this policy so much so that those who dare to trigger fights will be dealt with accordingly.  With this, it should be clear to everyone that instigators, hotheads and troublemakers have no place in the PBA and will be dealt with severely. Instigators also deserve special mention, especially those not even directly involved in the immediate action. They too will have to bear a heavy price for their act. Finally, I want to remind our players that long after sanctions have been served, your overall conduct's impression on our youth will continue to last. Be more circumspect in the future. Our players' responsibility of role modelling, particularly to our youth, is sacrosanct in the PBA."

Also if he is wounded and lying on the ground he may be faking it to get someone to drop their guard so he can kill them and escape. Anyone who uses a firearm to commit a crime immediately? relinquishes their right to life. People like you would like to change that and don't realize that you are 50 per cent of the problem in crime rate.

The reason y ppl kept saying it was Wade's team is cuz LeBron went to his team but LeBron was & is the best player. If Jordan went to that team there wouldn't be any question of who was the better player & regardless who was the leader of that team if there were talks about it Jordan? still would of dominated the mavs."

724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DUunt9XSiySWYl_U5Scm735-L4nLAOyN28	Speak for yourself. Kobe Bryant is NOT a top 3 player all time. He's not in? my top 5 I have him 7-8
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DV9nr5LYHJirOM4_H9LTqM_ooc-2nVKWGw	"Bird wasn't guarding just regular ""Fowards"". His match ups were Charles Barkley,Karl Malone,James Worthy,Charles Oakley,Dr J,Gervin,English,Bernard King,ETC.Plus Bird was the best player of his? team for his whole career.Kobe wasnt the best player of his team until 04-05."
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DVlBEFky6NxGyZF7Yrv6QgVzO6X2S1w1qU	"1. Jordan - As good a resume as you can get, 2. Hakeem - Most skilled? post scorer AND was the best defender in the toughest big man era. 3. Bird - Killer shooter/scorer/passer, good defender, tough, clutch, and a leader. 4. Duncan - Does everything, wins and never ages. 5. Magic - Offense.  Done. No overrated 60s/70s players that played when stats were inflated by pace & weak competition with less teams and shorter playoffs."
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DXBGCLmQ_-S6EouGsYEyjY1XoXQcBwI4-Y	Bird is easily better. -3 MVPs? (3 straight) -Better playoff performer -Better FINALS performer -more efficient (against tougher competition) -Better defender -Finished top 4 in MVP voting during his rookie year - Bird lead the league in win shares twice . Kobe has never lead the league in win shares -Higher defensive win shares -More clutch
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DXBn0TapfF0cS4scvMdRN9ggi4k-RQVXWg	"Better playoff performer  No.  Bird's PER in the playoffs dropped by 2.1 from his reg. avg. from 23.5 to 21.4. Kobe's PER in the playoffs drops by 1.0 - from 23.4 to 22.4,? Also Bird's eFG% dropped massively from 51.4 in the reg. season to 48.5 in the playoffs - Kobe only drops from 48.7 to 48.0.  You also can't say Bird played better D seeing as he played in a less explosive era & guarded forwards, not guards like Kobe. Also, Bird was 23 in his rookie year - Kobe @ 23 was also getting MVP buzz"
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DXGrN2w7JrSuNlTLtGbjpJDK3rryHW5gWE	michael jordan - kobe - the answer thats my top 3 ?
724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DXY6idECkKjgiYlobiIueQwcB_O0PEOo2Y	"Bird was a better leader & team player than Kobe, a better shooter than Kobe, a bigger rebounding presence than Kobe, a better passer than Kobe, has a higher career PER than Kobe, has more Win Shares/48 than Kobe, and won without ever having superstar-level help - unlike Kobe (yes, Gasol was playing like a superstar in? the 09-10 runs)."

Another thing nobody knows what the Clippers will be like with a real coach on their side now. Brooklyn has an entire new team that can really play defense now. Chicago has a healthy D. Rose. You're totally forgetting that. Even without him. We? almost beat them punk ass Heat. If we had our MVP it be a totally different story. This season doesn't belong to the Heat.

724-638|YT-bwKwiftfVmA-fat7bVHoGw2FgROEJuYp4paGpVF6bt61H-bXIHLpThs	Those are all good points but I would like to think that as he aged that post game would have developed earlier if it was required to. The hand checking point is true and i concede that completely but the lack of zone defense would be a major upside for him. Assuming? we aren't combining rules from different eras he could be dominant but in a more Jordan like blow bye way than a current all around man type. He'd get mad assists in any decade though.
724-638|YT-bwKwiftfVmA-fat7bVHoGw2Sa9YApP_bEezWIzLyiBuALmvEGHd-utw	As for the role players most of them are not going to have the effect on the game that the HoF judges usually require for them? to be inducted but we have an abundance of young athletic players who can come in and have a great impact for a time. They may not have long careers but there is always an abundance of talent that can run fast and jump high to make a splash in the league.
724-638|YT-bwKwiftfVmA-fat7bVHoGw2x3EOa82jCItU2t66SJDYOwtEGdIHMl4U	You listed a lot of centers. He would probably be driving past or into them but I doubt he would go 1v1 with them very often except in help situations maybe. Other than that if he was brought up in that time where he was allowed to give more contact and he was used to taking more contact he? would be accustomed to it just like everyone who played at the time was and he would thrive.

724-638|YT-5GQzh1-0jx8-sowEvCqS4DVnDKWLgwfBn7x6A6Uc8_tcMpHuvQWctBU	Ray Allen came there to join Lebron. You're acting like Lebron met him there and I'm pretty sure? Lebron can win a ring without Allen he has before. Magic had a big superstar like kareem. And Chris Bosh isn't as good as James Worthy for a third best player. As a matter of fact if Lebron could have chose to play with either wade or kareem I'm pretty sure he would choose the big man. As a matter of fact I'll take that 89 lakers over the 2013 Miami Heat anyday better team hands down.

But people tend to forget, MJ was a HUGE D-Bag. That Space Jam movie was only an act. There are lots of guys that think MJ was a D-Bag yet everyone still praises him like he is a god that will never be surpassed. LB will surpass him. Don't care about the rings because that is not the whole argument. By the way LBJ is not my fav player and not even close."
