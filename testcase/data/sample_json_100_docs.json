Magazines story on Karachi\n\nThe Editor Time Magazine \n\nDear Editor \n\nI recently returned from a charitable trip to Pakistan whereby I visited both Karachi and Islamabad I spoke with several universities key businesses prominent business leaders and several religious people from all generations \n\nOn the day I returned to the office someone had placed your magazine January 16 2012 on my desk I read with interest your article on Karachi and the city in doom For a person to have just returned from the very same place that your magazine described was somewhat bizarre so I read with great detail your writer Andrew Marshalls account \n\nLet me begin by saying that I often flick through your magazine and find the articles of great interest but on this particular day and this particular article I found certain comments to be both one sided and indeed very negative I say that because I saw a different Pakistan to what was portrayed in your article I do not and will not comment on the political or religious problems that the country faces but I will go so far as to say that not everything is as bad as the image that your magazine paints \n\nSure there are deaths in the cities Please show me a city in the world that is free from political fighting and unrest \n\nSure there are differences in the political party opinions Please show me a country in the world where the political parties agree \n\nSure the innocent are suffering Please show me a country in the world where wealth and power is equal and the innocent dont suffer \n\nSure corruption is in Pakistan Please show me a country in the world that is corruption free \n\nMy list could go on but my point is that Pakistan does have problemsbut so does every other country in the world in some way or another However in the case of ALL other nations there are often good things to report and the media goes out of its way to promote these good things across the globe whenever possible The ridiculous amount of shootings in the USA is balanced off by the success of Google Microsoft and Apple The financial dilemmas of Greece are lost in the marketing of the Greek Islands as a holiday destination of choice The child slave industry of India is brushed under the carpet in favour of the nations growth in the global software boom What I am trying to say is that someone needs to look further into Pakistan and see that there are millions of great stories to write about which would portray the country in a different light to that what is being portrayed by your article \n\nWhen I was in Pakistan I visited a towel manufacturing company Alkaram Towels They produced some 60million in export in 2011 and are aiming at 85million in 2012 A substantial increase in salesin a recession I would remind you The company was started by the current Chairman Mr Mehtab Chawla at the tender age of nine after his father passed away Today the very man employs 3000 staff Now thats a story \nI visited universities of NED Hamdard Karachi Szabist and NUST The students are unbelievably intelligent They spend their spare time developing APPS for android and apple They are involved in cutting edge technology and no one in the world knows this Why not send a reporter to Pakistan to look into this Why not research good things in this nation rather than just the bad things At NUST National Institution for Science and Technology  Islamabad there were 38000 applications for medicine There are only 83 seats for the medicine course on offer The competition is unbelievable In short it pushes the best to be even better But the world doesnt know this Why Because no one wants to report on it or no one knows about itor both \n\nPlease do not get me wrong I understand that news is news but it is high time that the western world stopped promoting these terrorists and political wars in Pakistan and started to write something that would help the nation Something positive If we really care about global partnerships and economic growth then I suggest we try and give Pakistan a helping hand There are 180 million people in Pakistan 65 are under the age of 25 The youth of Pakistan is its strength it is like a sleeping giant If you think that India is a booming nation I suggest you stop a second and look at Pakistan Given a little help from the western world Pakistan can become a dominant economy She doesnt want aid and she doesnt need money she just wants the chance to be seen in a different light I believe we have a fundamental obligation to assist The only question is who will reach out first \n\nWarmest regards \n\nTony Lazaro \nManaging Director \nRising Stars Management Group \nTel 02 8824 7000 \nFax 02 8824 7766 \n\nwwwrisingstarscomau  with Faeza Dawood and 19

people around the world", "message": "While pushing arms control measures and oversight of Canadian mining companies this Left party generally backs the military and a Western pro capitalist outlook to global affairs\n\nIn 2011 the NDP supported two House of Commons votes endorsing the bombing of Libya The partys most recent election platform called for maintaining the highest level of military spending since World War II\n\nAt its 1949 convention the CCF the NDPs predecessor passed a resolution supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO Even worse the party also expelled two elected legislators who were critical of NATO\n\nWhile officially the Wests response to an aggressive Soviet Union NATO was in fact established to blunt the European Left and extend North American European power in light of the de colonization taking place in Asia and the Middle East NATO planners feared a weakening of self confidence among Western Europes elite and the widely held belief that communism was the wave of the future External Minister Lester Pearson was fairly open about NATOs purpose telling the House of Commons in March 1949 The power of the communists wherever that power flourishes depends upon their ability to suppress and destroy the free institutions that stand against them They pick them off one by one the political parties the trade unions the churches the schools the universities the trade associations even the sporting clubs and the kindergartens The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is meant to be a declaration to the world that this kind of conquest from within will not in the future take place amongst us Tens of thousands of North American troops were stationed in Western Europe to deter any conquest from within\n\nThe other major motivating factor for the North American elite was a desire to rule the world For Canadian officials the North Atlantic pact justified European North American dominance across the globe As part of the parliamentary debate over NATO Pearson said There is no better way of ensuring the security of the Pacific Ocean at this particular moment than by working out between the great democratic powers a security arrangement the effects of which will be felt all over the world including the Pacific area\n\nIn the eyes of Pearson and the US leadership NATOs first major test took place far from the North Atlantic in Korea After the Communists took control of China in 1949 the US tried to encircle the country They supported Chiang Kai shek in Taiwan built military bases in Japan backed a right wing dictator in Thailand and tried to establish a pro Western state in Vietnam The success of Chinas nationalist revolution also spurred the 19501953 Korean War in which eight Canadian warships and 27000 Canadian troops participated The war left as many as four million dead\n\nThe 1950 CCF convention endorsed Canadas decision to join the US led though UN sanctioned war in Korea It wasnt until huge numbers had died and China entered the war that the CCF started questioning Ottawas military posture\n\nIn the early 1950s Iranians pushed to gain greater benefit from their huge oil reserves But the British had different plans As one of the earliest sources of Middle Eastern oil the Anglo Iranian Oil Company British Petroleums predecessor had generated immense wealth for British investors since 1915\n\nWith Anglo Iranian refusing to concede any of their immense profits Iran moved to nationalize the countrys oil industry It was a historic move that made Iran the first former colony to reclaim its oil\n\nDespite calling for the nationalization of numerous sectors of the Canadian economy the leader of the CCF criticized Irans move On October 22 1951 MJ Coldwell told the House of Commons What happened recently in Iran the nationalization of oil and is now taking place in Egypt abrogation of a treaty that allowed British forces to occupy the Suez Canal region is an attempt on the part of these reactionary interests to use theunderstandable desire of the great masses of the people for improvements intheir condition as an excuse to obtain control of the resources of these countries and to continue to exploit the common people in these regions The CCF leader then called on the federal government to give every possible aid to the United Kingdom in the present crisis\n\nMohammad Mossadeghs move to nationalize Irans oil would lead the US and UK to orchestrate his overthrow in 1953 The CCF failed or at least its not recorded in the Hansard parliamentary debate to criticize Ottawa for backing the overthrow of Irans first popularly elected Prime Minister\n\nNo issue better reflects international policy tensions within the party than Israel Zionism Initially the CCF opposed the nationalism and imperialism associated with Zionism In 1938 CCF leader JS Woodsworth stated It was easy for Canadians Americans and the British to agree to a Jewish colony as long as it was somewhere else Why pick on the Arabs other than for strategic and imperialistic consideration At its 1942 convention the CCF condemned Nazi anti Semitism but refused to endorse Zionism The Jewish problem can be solved only in a socialist and democratic society which recognized no racial or class differences explained a party resolution\n\nBut before Israels creation the CCF officially endorsed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine In September 1945 new CCF leader M J Coldwell said the Zionist record in Palestine in terms of both social and economic justice spoke for itself Three decades later in 1975 NDP MP and former leader Tommy Douglas told Israels racist Histadrut labour federation The main enmity against Israel is that she has been an affront to those nations who do not treat their people and their workers as well as Israel has treated hers This speech was made eight years into Israels occupation of the West Bank Golan Heights and Gaza Strip and a quarter century after 800000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed during the 1948 war\n\nWhile better today this extreme deference to Israel has yet to be expunged from the party In May 2008 the soon to be NDP leader Thomas Mulcair was quoted in the Canadian Jewish News saying I am an ardent supporter of Israel in all situations and in all circumstances\n\nhttp

at the Stop the War event  Owen Jones and Jeremy Scahill  were urged by Mother Agnes enemies via Twitter not to share a platform with the nun Dear Owen Jeremy do you know who youre sharing a platform with style tweets were sent The two were sent links to articles attacking Mother Agnes\n\nJones and Scahill unfortunately bowed to the pressure and said that they would withdraw from the conference if Mother Agnes was also on the platform At the weekend Stop the War announced that Mother Agnes had withdrawn from the conference Her dignified graceful letter to Stop the War was in sharp contrast to the nastiness of the attacks made on her by her accusers\n\nWhy were the liberal hawks and supporters of the Syrian revolution so frightened of an elderly nun addressing a Stop the War conference If she really was a crackpot  another claim made against her  then surely that would have been obvious to those listening to her Lots of lurid claims have been made against Mother Agnes someone even claimed on Twitter on Tuesday that she worked with Assad intelligence but evidence to back up the claims is decidedly thin on the ground\n\nThe reason she has been attacked  and why it was so important to stop her speaking at the Stop the War event  is because her first hand account of what has actually been happening in Syria challenges the dominant western narrative\n\nThis dominant narrative says that all the deaths in Syria are the responsibility of the Evil Dictator Bashar al Assad a crazed Hitleresque tyrant who since 2011 has been massacring his own people and has even used chemical weapons against them The dominant narrative says that the Syrian conflict is a clear case of Good vs Evil the anti Assad rebels are Good Assad and his government are Evil\n\nMother Agnes testimony challenges this dominant narrative  which is why for the liberal hawks she is so dangerous\n\nEveryone in Syria is facing grave danger There was a case of Muslim religious leaders being kidnapped and beheaded They were humiliated and tortured Ismailis the Druze Christians  people from all parts of Syrian society  are being mass murdered I would like to say that if these butchers didnt have international support no one would have dared to cross the line But today unfortunately the violation of human rights and genocide in Syria is covered up on the international level Mother Agnes told RT in September\n\nIn the same interview she also questioned the dominant narrative which said that the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical weapons attack at Ghouta in August\n\nThe appalling atrocities committed by the rebels  which include the regular terrorist bombing of civilian targets and beheadings need to be played down otherwise the plebs will be asking why are our governments in the west siding with such people In the same way the dominant narrative regarding the Ghouta attack   ie that it was carried out by Assad  must under no circumstances be questioned  even if no conclusive evidence has yet been produced to prove that the Syrian government was indeed responsible\n\nMother Agnes testimony reveals that the so called War on Terror is a sham   that in Syria the western countries and their regional allies Saudi Arabia and Israel are on the same side as the extremist Islamic terror groups that we are told are our greatest enemies\n\nThe aim of this pro Assad labelling is to marginalise those who dispute the dominant narrative Someone labelled as pro Assad is deemed by elite gatekeepers to be outside civilised debate but of course there is no such exclusion order served on those who support or defend rebels who bomb innocent civilians behead people and who persecute Christians and religious minorities\n\nhttp  rtcom op edge mother

hypocritical move the United Nations General Assembly Rights Committee voted on Tuesday for a resolution which strongly condemned what it claims are human rights violations in Syria and laid the blame for both the atrocities committed during the course of the two year conflict and the high death toll at the feet of the Syrian government  According to France24 the resolution passed overwhelmingly with 123 nations in favor 13 opposed and 46 abstentions  The resolution strongly condemned the continued widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and all violations of international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities and the government affiliated shabbiha militias  It is important to note that the resolution was actually drafted by Saudi Arabia a country that has been instrumental in funding directing and facilitating the death squads that were set loose on Syria two years ago It is highly ironic of course that Saudi Arabia would sponsor and or draft any resolution that would in any way criticize another nation in regards to its alleged human rights violations considering the abysmal human rights record that the nation itself maintains  This hypocritical aspect was pointed out by the Syrian UN envoy Bashar Jaffaari when he stated that The Saudi regime is the last one that can talk about human rights given its black record in the domain  Jaafari clearly has a point To this day Saudi Arabia continues to openly carry out brutal executions of criminals political dissidents and those accused of sorcery or witchcraft These executions are carried out by means of beheadings in the capitol of Riyadh in an area known as Chop Chop Square In addition womens rights in Saudi Arabia are virtually non existent with women not even afforded the right to drive Voting too is restricted for women in local elections Voting by women in national elections is a non issue since Saudi Arabia does not have national elections due to its status as an absolute monarchy  Nevertheless in an ironic statement Saudi envoy Abdullah al Mouallimi claimed that the purpose of the resolution was to highlight the suffering imposed on people in Syria such as mass killing genocide starvation torture oppression kidnapping terrorism and abduction Of course each and every one of these charges apply to the death squads funded by Saudi Arabia and operating inside Syria  The death squads have been responsible for unspeakable atrocities against innocent people ever since the destabilization effort began In October 2012 the death squads in typical terrorist fashion conducted at least four suicide bombings in Aleppo that killed around 40 innocent civilians  Numerous other atrocities have also been documented with videos showing the death squads machine gunning captives beheading prisoners see here and here and forcing young children to behead them I myself have written an article dealing with reports regarding the death squads hanging

of the torture of prisoners in the hands of the death squads are legion One need only type the relevant keywords into a YouTube search engine to be greeted with generous results In June 2013 death

\nTHOUGHTS ARE THINGS\n01 24 2014\n  \n \nI took a short walk today I was listening to my favorite music and I found GRACE\n\nThere comes a time that we realize true joy is in the not knowing what you dont know Finding that child within and creating what you see and wish to be That is where the magic begins Although I struggle to keep myself in that space of GRACE I know that it is always there As I shed the baggage that has been programmed into my mind by many factions such as\n\nMainstream Media\n\nCorporations\n\nReligions\n\nFear Mongers\n\nTV Shows\n\nControlled Musicians\n\nOther peoples views and ideas\n\nJust to name a few there are many more and its been going on for eons I sit back and wonder when is the madness going to end I think there comes a point in most peoples lives and I dont speak for everyone here but I think the point that comes in most peoples lives is when they sit back and realize SOMETHING IS JUST NOT RIGHT Did we really come into this life to work our butts off at jobs we dont like impose someone elses ideas of what the social norm should be on our children get sucked into the religious dogma of an all loving God whatever that means to you who in the way he is depicted by religions is anything but pick up the latest fashion tease because someone else said it was cool listen to Government parties who fight for the same corporate teams for the richest peoples ideologies and control feeling like your always reaching and reaching but always have that lack of did we really come here to experience this \n\nWell I can say from my point of view and many others that I know of that this is NOT what we came here to experience We came here to experience love joy laughter friendship union community our hearts desires excitement play games and GRACE Where can we find this In a world that feels as if its been turned upside down and shoved through the meat grinder one must find this only WITHIN We started off great and well then we got usurped We started listening to other peoples ideas and how THEY wanted things to be and how THEY thought they should go We believed them because well most of us have by true nature a loving trusting soul There are certain people in the world at this point who own all the big things that give us our subjective programming to follow Its considered the social norm You hear it from people who stand before you with their special little plaque or degree that names them a Dr or Lawyer or what not and all the sudden they seem to have all the answers that you couldnt possibly have We give our power away to them and every time we do this it creates THEIR reality \n\nWe are just as much to blame for all the things going on in the world today as they are All they did was feed us the IDEAS and well being our loving trusting selves we foolishly went along for the ride Its time to wake up and get back to where we were supposed to be and be who we are supposed to be Its time to WAKE UP to who we really are Everything is energy in life including thoughts This has been scientifically proven many times over the most recognized study of this is in the Hundredth Monkey Effect To help you understand this I will explain it in a short manner\n\nMonkeys on one island started to eat an item on that island this item made them sick So one monkey just one decided he was going to wash it off in the water He did so and ate it and he no longer got sick On this island it became a major thing with all the monkeys Sure youre probably going monkey see monkey do right Well here is the kicker On a different island many many miles away around the same exact time the monkeys there started doing the same thing So what caused this Lets explain it in lemans terms to make it easy Thoughts are things theyre energy and they create our reality They also go up into a huge Field and well you can tap into that Field We do this on a daily basis all over the place Someone invents something in one part of the world and at the same time on the other side of the world another person invents the same thing Its not that they just randomly had the same thought We finish peoples sentences call our mom at the same time she said she was calling us One thought is all it takes to change things and make things happen but when you get an entire planet of people thinking the same things well that is manifestation on steroids \n\nLets think of the Field as a big huge super computer We are the ones who are the operating system of that big super computer That computer does not work without our yes you guessed it THOUGHTS So if someone new this knowledge and wanted to brainwash and hypnotize an entire world how would they go about this You guessed it THOUGHTS They know how powerful we are when we come together and they dont like the idea that well we dont like their THOUGHTS anymore Theres are full of fear hate anger sexual acts immorality sickness poverty aggression and so much more So of course if I wanted to control the world and all the people that live on it and keep it the way I wanted it so that I had all the power control and money out of letting my EGO run ramped and eventually take over who I was I would definitely make sure I brainwashed everyone into the systems that are currently set into place I would make you be LIE ve this is how it is and this is how it works \n\nI would write your History Books take control of your Space Programs such as NASA I would make you think because I had a title I knew better and you well you are just a peon and know nothing I would make sure I took control of how power was provided to the populace I would take control of all the large corporations so the tiny little CLICK that I formed back in time with the same type of so called special people would operate like a well oiled machine I would control all of the Media outlets Entertainment Industries and eventually take over the water and the food Then I would set out to let everyone be LIE ve that special people or governments owned all the land by printing our own money and brainwashing people into be LIE veing you cant have nothing without paying for it I would slowly take over and make you feel like you have to ask someone else for anything in life You need permission to even drive on the same roads that are on this big huge planet that belongs to each and every one of us When did we let it get this bad When did we let people convince us that things were just not right and give someone else the power to decide our fate\n\nYeah things on the outside might seem okay to some people you have a house you have a car you have a job you have your children and family and all those nice things That actually is part of the hypnotizing because your too busy worrying about how to keep those going by paying your house payment car payment electric bill gas bill buy your clothes health insurance and the list can go on and on with all your worries and concerns What happened to the good old days when people just did things because they needed to be done and worked together Ever ask yourself if it makes sense to have to pay to live on the planet you were born on Things were NOT meant to be this way We are meant to create our own reality We are meant to be in control of who we are and BE who we are That which we have inwardly we project outwardly and that shapes our entire reality So we can basically at this point say that they are the directors and we are just the actors in this big game called life I personally do not like being the actor anymore and I want to be the director but I want to be the director with the rest of Humanity the director of me We all want the same basic things when you think about it Happiness love joy laughter health wealth abundance and that list can go on and on and on Lets stop being so unkind towards each other because someone else taught you to Last I checked children do not see hate color religion creed sin They see love and joy because they seek it out Its not until that unwitting indoctrination from those of us playing the puppets field such as teachers bankers fast food servers priest soldiers immigrants illegal aliens conspiracy theorist liberals demos conservatives Mormons Christian Muslim Buddhist Hindu short fat skinny burnt sick not rich too rich evil good better car darker skin lighter skin beginning or the end  WHO CARES Now after reading that sit back and remember WHO TAUGHT YOU those  things We are all guilty because we listened to everything else that was OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES Inside 999 of us we are so full of love and we want out of that cage That cage just keeps repeating itself over and over until one day we Wake Up You did not think that crap it was fed to you by THEM Start to own what you focus on intend wish see the beauty all around you and most of all Within You Be that amazing beautiful Being of Light that you truly are Be LOVE and do LOVE The more love you DO and BE the faster that will manifest before us Imagine your Sovereignty Take back your PRESENCE\n\nThe thing is we cant get these things when we are unhappy on the inside When we are carrying around all the emotional crap from our past or all the indoctrination that has been bestowed upon us by our unknowing parents leaders caretakers school teachers and so on and so forth There comes a point when we must start to question Question everything get out of that box we live in Realize the world around us is so much more than the normal crap we worry about on a daily basis We only have one Earth and one type of people here which are HUMANS The next time you want to rant and rave about illegal aliens or someone that happens to be a different color or belongs to a specific religion or lives in a different country ask yourself this deep down Why do you think they are illegal aliens and bad and WHO told you they are Is that your own thought or something that someone else conjured up and bestowed upon you and you just ran with it because well it felt right or its the social norm We have to be more in control of who we are and what is really real in life If we keep on trucking along this way by listening to what the people in power or money grubbers who own the entire Entertainment Industry Governments and much more say then were just going to keep going down the road THEY want to take us I personally dont want to see whats at the end of that road If you do then youre more than welcome to join that road and keep on trucking along in doom and gloom\n\nHow do we fix this mess That is actually easier than one might think Currently there is many people on the inside taking this current system down to give back control and power to the PEOPLE which is us We cant sit around and just wait for someone else to do all that work They are doing the physical work but we have to do the physical and emotional work ourselves Faith without works is pointless We cant sit around all day and meditate and spew love and light and expect it to all go away What we need to do is go within We need to fix ourselves and get rid of all that programming Start living in happiness health wealth and abundance No matter your situation there is always something to be in gratitude for and that something is YOU You are a very powerful being A being of Light You created this mess and just helped pull the strings by playing along with the illusion as if that was the true reality Now lets snap out of it forgive ourselves and all others involved with the illusion and move on to happier times and a happier reality Lets clean up our thoughts stop paying attention to the lies and propaganda that are bestowed upon us Turn off your idiot boxes and stop being sheep and cattle for the guys that still THINK they are up top of the ladder directing this play\n\nI FOR ONE QUIT THIS PLAY  I AM HEADED TO A DIFFERENT ONE There is a new play over here that is going to be called The Golden Age and those of you who want to join are more than welcome There are some requirements before you are fully in this play though You must shed all negative energies and baggage that have not been serving you in your Divine Good and Truth Go within and start loving yourself again and I mean really loving YOU OWN YOUR FIELD and dont let all that negative crap in it serves us NO purpose at all Remember GRACE that child within and BE that child within I no longer see good and evil I have transcended duality myself I find that each person at this point has their part to play in this game but in the end I myself dont want to be on the stage when THEIR play comes crashing down on them I want to be on the other stage with open arms a loving heart forgiveness and acceptance I want to be on this stage of ONENESS  Therefore from now on since thoughts are things and what we think of we create I am no longer giving any of my energy to anything that does NOT serve me or Humanity in mine or Humanities Highest Divine Good and Truth If you want to join me we shall make a community of LOVE Be the Godly Beings of Light you all are and lets show them how and lead by example FREE WILL was thwarted and we let it be so lets take it back Own it and BE IT\n\nNamaste", "id": "200000000110812_739286836081313", "updated_time": "2014-01-26T19:47:02+0000", "caption": "wwwyoutubecom", "application": {"name": "Links",
